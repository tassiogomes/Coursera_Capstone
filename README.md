# Introduction 
Many world metropolises have overpopulation and high purchasing power in common. This mixture of ingredients often leads to high crime rates.
Since tourists do not have an in-depth knowledge of common crime points, this project was inspired by the protection of these tourists.

## Real world case

In general, every traveler, whether for business or pleasure, intends to enjoy a little of the place and have fun.
Inspired by a scenario in which some co-workers will go to Chicago on business, they will have a few more days to explore the city. Knowing them, I know they like to go out at night after work and drink some drikes and listen to good music.

This project's main idea is to predict the potential for a crime to happen close to a nightclub search on foursquare.

Let's go!

# Data
In this session I will quickly explain the origin and method of data acquisition.

**Crimes occurred in Chicago in 2019** - The data were accessed at: https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2019/w98m-zvie, where the API was generated to download in https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/views/w98m-zvie/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD&api_foundry=true.
